// tried Rebass which was cool but couldn't get any explanation anywhere of what the default themeing values were for things like breakpoints, and how to override them. Something to do with creating stuff in this file, importing it to Layout along with a ThemeProvider thing which wraps around the app. Then the props declared in this file should be available in the Rebass components. Spent literally days trying to figure that stuff out but there literally does not exist a clear explanation online.
