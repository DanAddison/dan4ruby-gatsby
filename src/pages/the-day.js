      <Question>First things first... Covid?</Question>
      <Answer>Yeah... please do a test</Answer>
      <AnswerBody>
        <p>We think it's a fairly safe bet that the party will go ahead this time. We've scaled down the guest list quite a bit, but there won't be much social distancing going on in the modest factory space. As such we ask that you <em>do not attend without having done a negative lateral flow test</em> on the morning of the event. As most of you will know by now, it's quick, easy and cheap to get test packs sent to your home.</p>

      <Question>Can I park there?</Question>
      <Answer>No, sorry</Answer>
      <AnswerBody>
        <p>There is no available parking at the factory, and the surrounding streets are often chock-a-block.</p>
      </AnswerBody>

      <Question>What time is it?</Question>
      <Answer>3pm</Answer>
      <AnswerBody>
        <p>You can expect something like this:</p>
        <List>
          <li>Arrive between 2:30-2:45pm</li>
          <li>Some sort of low-key wedding ceremony at 3pm</li>
          <li>Eat and drink and mingle for a while</li>
          <li>Have a boogie</li>
          <li>11pm curfew (it's a quiet residential street)</li>
        </List>

      <Question>What's for tea?</Question>
      <Answer>Big ol' buffet</Answer>
      <AnswerBody>
        <p>We'll have loads of buffet food, largely homemade by kind friends/family, and this should satisfy all dietary requirements. If you fancy chipping in yourself with a dish of some sort, let us know!</p>
      </AnswerBody>

      <Question>What shall I bring?</Question>
      <Answer>A bottle</Answer>

        <p>We'll be providing some bubbly, wine, beer and soft drinks, but we'll also be stocking up our homemade bar with your contributions as you arrive. You'll be able to drop booze off at the Factory on the day/evening before, if that's easier.</p>
