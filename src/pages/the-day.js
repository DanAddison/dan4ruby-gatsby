          <li>The ceremony will take place at 2pm</li>

      <Answer>A bottle</Answer>
      <AnswerBody>
        <p>We'll be providing some bubbly, wine, beer and soft drinks, but your appetites will be far deeper than our pockets. We'll be stocking up our homemade bar with your contributions as you arrive. You'll also be able to drop booze off at the Factory on the day/evening before, if that's easier.</p>
        <p>Just to reiterate, as this is arguably the most crucial piece of info on this site: <span>bring booze!!</span></p>
